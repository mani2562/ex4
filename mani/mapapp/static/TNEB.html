Paruvathamalai holds a sacred place in my heart — a memory etched in time. During my 9th standard, I visited this divine mountain just once, yet it left a lasting mark. Climbing to the top to see Lord Shiva was both a spiritual and emotional journey. That day was unforgettable, not just for the view, but for the company I cherished. My sister, my cousins, and I — together we shared laughter, devotion, and adventure. It wasn't just a visit; it was a moment of bonding, faith, and pure joy.
